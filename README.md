justrec - a JavaScript + Flash Microphone MP3 Recording
=======

JustRec stands for JavaScript MP3 Recording.

It allows to save users' recordings as MP3 files on server.

It uses Adobe Flash(tm) (ActionScript) engine (justrec.swf)
to embed recording and MP3-converting capabilities inside any HTML page.

Flash plugin does not have any view for recording,
it hides behind your HTML layout and pops out only once during a session
while requesting access to user's camera and microphone.

You should make view and model for recording by HTML and JavaScript means.

You can communicate with ActionScript in your JavaScript file,
using ExternalInterface callbacks.

See http://beotiger.com/justrec for home page of the project.
